# Odin Landing Page

by KyloFPS

---

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page)'s 'Foundations' corriculum. In it, I had the chance to practice my newly-aquired HTML and CSS skills â€” especially Flexbox.

The website's design was given, and the assignment was to use an image of the website to recreate it, without any of the source code.

## Learning Outcomes

- I learned to use the CSS flexbox to accurately align elements as was specified by the given image.
- I learned to mentally break down a website's layout to determine how to arrange the 'boxes' (elements) to achieve that result.
- I reinforced my learning of good programming practices:
  - I wrote concise and helpful commit messages
  - I committed to the project often using Git in order to properly version control my project.
